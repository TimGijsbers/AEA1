Personal Profile
---------

Currently I am a student in his third year of Economics at Tilburg University. Besides my study I try to keep myself occupied with a lot of different projects and activities.  When I join a project or activity, I always give myself for 100%, and I also expect this from others.
While I prefer team assignments, I have no problems to work independently for longer periods of time. 

When presented with a problem I am quite analytic. I see cause and effect relations quite fast and I like a challenge. This could be a complex societal problem or a more economic focused assignment that does not really matter for me. I like both types of challenges.
Besides doing formal things, I also like to do fun things in my spare time. I like meeting up with friends and going to the movie theater. I also like running. Not that I am a professional at it, or have plans to join a marathon soon, but it just helps me to clear my mind.

Extra Activities

* 2014 – 2016	Outreaching Honors Program
Vice-President

The Outreaching Honors program is an on-top-of program that a select group of ambitious students can follow at Tilburg University. The aim of the program is to improve the skills of students by allowing them to work in teams, work on projects, train leadership qualities and solve complex societal problems.
Currently I am vice-president of our cohort of 50 students. Last year my role was to contact firms and interesting speakers to connect with our program.

* 2015 - 2016	Calling Campaign
Training and Supervising of the students

Last year I supervised a Calling Campaign to raise support from alumni for Tilburg University. The campaign lasted for 4 weeks, with several weeks of preparation. The support we asked for ranged from financial gifts to internships or research projects for students. My role in the calling campaign was to recruit and help train the students who were calling, and to supervise them during the campaign

* 2016 – 2017	Stichting Keygro
Acquisition and Client Management

Stichting Keygro is one of the projects I am currently involved in. This foundation aims at improving the presentation skills of high school students. We do this by providing them with trainings in presentation skills and group dynamics. With these trainings we want to make them more confident when giving a speech or a presentation. My role in the foundation is the acquisition of new schools, and to manage the schools that we currently have as a client.

* 2016 – 2017	Project Talent Management for handicapped youth Data Analyst

This is another project that I currently work on. Unemployment is an important problem, especially youth unemployment. In this project we try to help the most youngsters with a handicap that wants to enter the labor market. My role is to match their competences to companies in a better way, so that it becomes easier for them to find an internship or a job. I do this by evaluating the current assessment method, and find ways to improve these assessments to better connect to the demands of the companies.
