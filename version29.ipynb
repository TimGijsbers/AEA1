    "\n",
    "In this notebook we show the application of a simple Cournot Model with indirect network effects to the Social Media Market. We use Python to analyse and graphycally represent the model. For this analysis we adopt the developed model by professors Jens PrÃ¼fer and Cedric Argenton in the reaserch paper: [\"Search Engine Competition with Network Externalities.\"](https://jensprufer.files.wordpress.com/2014/08/argenton-prufer-search-engine-competition_jcle.pdf) In their research, the authors developed a model for search engine competition taking into account network externalities and show the development of market shares for each player.

    "\n",
    "After taking the Seminar on Innovation & Networks taught by professor Prufer and professor Willems, we were intrigued by the model on of search engine competition with indirect network effects. The model's prediction of a market leader (Google) increasing its market shares and driving the smallest player out of the market (Bing) coinside with reality. \n",
    "In the search engine market, the long-term stable outcome will be one monopolist, due to heavy network effects of this market.\n",

    "In this part we will apply the model described above to the Social Media market. In the graph below, we present all firms in this market, and their market shares from 2011 - 2016. This graph has been created by Priit Kallas, and the original graph can be found [here](http://www.dreamgrow.com/top-10-social-networking-sites-market-share-of-visits/). In the graph, market share is defined as the percentage of users using the Social Media product. The y-axis is a logaritmic scale, since there are a lot of very small players in the market. "

    "What we see if we look at the graph, is that there are three large players in 2008, Myspace, Youtube and facebook. The other firms that are active in the Social Media market each have a market share of at most 2%, so we will ignore them for our analysis. What we are left with is effectively a Triopoly market. One firm that immediately catches attention is Myspace. The market share of this firm dropped very fast after 2008. In order to focus more on the behavior of the largest three players, we created a different graph. This graph is presented below, and shows only the three largest firms, from the period 2008 - 2011."

    "You can look at these three firms as the triopoly case we described earlier. In this situation, we expect that one of the firms will recieve a lower and lower market share, while the other two firms expand. In the case of Facebook vs Myspace, this is quite comparable to the Search Engine market. Both firms offer a very comparable product, but the more people that use one brand, the more attractive it becomes. If all of your friends have a facebook account, you will probably see little reason to open up a Myspace account. As the model predicts, over time one of the firms will lose market share and eventually leave the market. "

    "What we see in this graph contradicts the outcome of the model. Where we expected to find that one firm would take over the market, it seems that they are slowly converging over time. We believe that this is due to the different type of service that Facebook and Youtube offer. Where Myspace and Facebook offered an almost identical product, Facebook and Youtube offer different servicss. This makes it more likely that a user will use both products, but use them both for a different goal. We do not end up in a monopoly market structure, but in a structure with monopolistic competition."

    "In this notebook, we first have shown how the model by[Jens PrÃ¼fer and Cedric Argenton](https://jensprufer.files.wordpress.com/2014/08/argenton-prufer-search-engine-competition_jcle.pdf) works. We have shown the examples of a Triopoly and Duopoly market, to illustrate the impact of Network effects on a cournot market.\n",
    "\n",
    "After the introduction of the model, we compared the model to the Social Media market. We conclude that the Cournot model with network effects can be used as an approximation for the social media market. However, this only works as long as the services that 2 firms provide are close enough to one another. If two firms offer an almost identical service (Myspace and Facebook), we expect one of them to leave the market over time. However, if the sevices provided differ (Facebook and Youtube), there is room for multiple firms in one market. In the latter case we end up with monopolistic competition, instead of a monopoly.\n",
    "\n",
    "Specifically for the Social Media market, we find that firms provide hetrogenous products. We observe two large firms, Facebook and Youtube, who offer different services to their users. This allows users to make use of both Social Media, using them as complements instead of substitutes. Next to that we have a lot of smaller firms in the market, who operate in Niche markets. These firms have less that 2 percent market share each, and most of them offer a specific type of service. Over time you would expect most of the niche players to exit the market again, unless they can attract a large enough user base by offering a different product. If their product is too close to Facebook or Youtube (or even another niche player), we expect to see what the model predicts, where one firm exits the market after a few periods. \n",
    "\n",
    "We see no direct way of preventing Facebook and Youtube from maintaining their dominant position, unless you force them to cooperate with other Social Media firms."
